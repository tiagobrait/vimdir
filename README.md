# vimdir

My (new) vim/neovim config directory.
---
Changes from the [old one](https://github.com/tiagobrait/vimdir-old) include going from [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) to [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) for plugin management and removing some plugins I wasn't using anymore.
